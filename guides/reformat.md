### Reformatting your MacBook

Before reformatting your machine, **make sure that you have backed up all of your data**—documents, pictures, local code, etc. Personally most of my stuff is sitting somewhere on the cloud so this process is relatively pain-free, but back in the day I used to have a thick bundle of 8 GB USB sticks that I would carefully distribute all my files across.

1. Restart your laptop, and immediately press and hold ⌘R.
2. In recovery mode, select and launch Disk Utility.
3. Using Disk Utility, reformat your disk volume (usually named `Macintosh HD`) as an APFS volume (the default option).

   > The APFS Case-sensitive option is generally [not recommended](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/for-apfs-any-reason-not-to-use-case-sensitivity.2071360/) because some software can encounter issues with case-sensitivity.

4. Quit Disk Utility, then select `Reinstall macOS Ventura` (or the latest macOS version).
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to reinstall and set up macOS Ventura.
