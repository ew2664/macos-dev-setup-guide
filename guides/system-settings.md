### Configuring system settings

> This section was written before Apple [revamped](https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/84141-how-macos-venturas-system-settings-differs-from-the-previous-system-preferences/) the System Preferences app and turned it into macOS Ventura's System Settings. Some details may be outdated.

Honestly, I'm only including this section as a memo for myself because everyone's set-up and preferences will be different. For example, I use iCloud Drive and type in traditional Chinese, which I doubt will be the case for most. But feel free to use my settings as a reference anyways.

1. Launch `System Preferences`.
   - Under `Apple ID`, enable iCloud Drive to start syncing your files.
   - Under `Dock & Menu Bar`, disable Show recent applications in Dock.
   - Under `Mission Control`, disable Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use. Open `Hot Corners` and disable all four hot corners.
   - Under `Internet Accounts`, add your school, work, and personal Gmail accounts. Disable `Contacts` and `Notes` for them and set the account descriptions accordingly.
   - Under `Keyboard > Input Sources`, add the Chinese, Traditional > Pinyin keyboard. Enable Use Caps Lock key to switch to and from U.S. and Show Input menu in menu bar.
   - Under `Sound > Sound Effects`, set Show Sound in menu bar to always.
2. Launch `Finder` and go to `Finder > Preferences` in the menu bar.
   - Under `General`, set New Finder windows show to Documents.
   - Under `Advanced`, enable Show all filename extensions.
3. If you have a Windows keyboard, launch System Preferences and go to `Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys`. Select your keyboard from the dropdown options and set Option (⌥) Key to ⌘ Command and Command (⌘) Key to ⌥ Option.
