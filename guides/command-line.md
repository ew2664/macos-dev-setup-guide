### Setting up your macOS command line

#### Homebrew

The first thing I like to do is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), an open-source package manager for Macs. I install almost everything through Homebrewâ€”utilities, dev tools, applications, etc., as we'll see in a bit.

1. Launch Terminal (don't worry, we'll install the much better iTerm2 later).
2. Install Homebrew with curl.

   ```shell
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Make sure everything is up to date.
   ```shell
   brew update
   ```
