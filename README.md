I have this fun annual ritual: every year, I purge my laptop and set it back up from factory settings. This might sound a bit excessive—honestly, I'm pretty sure this isn't officially recommended. But as a student and growing software developer, I find myself constantly working with new tools. Most of the time I don't set them up the right or best way on the first try, and layers upon layers of clutter start accumulating on my machine. This is a simple, half-decent albeit brutish way I've found for getting rid of that clutter.

I really enjoy this process—there's something therapeutic about a [hard reset](https://madison365.com/time-for-a-hard-reset/) and starting from scratch, especially when the busyness of our lives threatens to consume everything. And above that, there seems to be something philosophically profound about an annual rebirth—a chance for me to shed old skin and reflect on what I've gained. Or maybe, I just like the feeling of a shiny brand new laptop, and this is the cheapest way I can mimic that. So ... here I am.

This guide started as a sloppy list on a Word document sitting on my desktop that I touched up once a year, until the summer of 2022 when I moved it onto a personal Notion page for easier access. Then some friends starting asked me to share the page with them, which led me to think, perhaps more people can benefit from this. I know there's a ton of these setup guides out there, but just maybe, my take on the "best macOS dev setup" can end up being of use to someone. So if you're that someone, here you go!

#### A few notes on the guide ...

I own a [2017 15-inch MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP756?locale=en_US) currently running [macOS Ventura](https://www.apple.com/macos/ventura/), and this guide will be primarily based on my setup. I imagine that some of the software I install or configurations I use may have compatibility issues with the newer M1 or M2 Macbooks, so you may need to do a bit of your own research in that regard.

I also don't actively maintain this guide. Major updates will probably happen once a year when I do my annual reset, with minor fixes or additions sprinkled in between. So not everything on here will be the most up-to-date.
