# macOS Dev Setup Guide

[![Profile Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ew2664/macos-dev-setup-guide?label=last%20updated&style=flat)](https://github.com/ew2664/macos-dev-setup-guide)

I have this fun annual ritual: every year, I [purge my laptop](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-factory-reset-mac-windows-chromebook/) and set it back up from factory settings. This is most definitely excessive. But as a student and young software developer, I'm constantly working with new languages and tools, and unfortunately I tend to [butcher their set-up](https://xkcd.com/1987/) the first time. This is just a simple, half-decent, brutish way for me to get rid of all the clutter and junk I generate.

Apart from that, there's also just something oddly therapeutic about a [hard reset](https://madison365.com/time-for-a-hard-reset/) when the busyness of life threatens to consume everything. It's an opportunity to shed old skin and reflect on the changes of the past year. And of course I like the feeling of a shiny brand new laptop, and this is the [cheapest way](https://youtu.be/njos57IJf-0?t=66) I can mimic that.

This guide started as a dusty Word document on my desktop that I touched up once a year. In the summer of 2022, I migrated it onto a personal Notion page for easier access. Then friends starting asked me to share the page with them, which led me to think, maybe more people can benefit from this? There's a ton of dev setup guides out there, but maybe mine will end up being of use to someone?

So if you're that someone, here you go!

### A few notes on the guide ...

I own a [2017 15-inch MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP756?locale=en_US) currently running [macOS Ventura](https://www.apple.com/macos/ventura/), and this guide will be primarily based on my setup. I imagine that some of the software I install or configurations I use may have compatibility issues with the newer M1 or M2 Macbooks, so you may need to do a bit of your own research in that regard.

I also don't actively maintain this guide. Major updates will probably happen once a year when I do my annual reset, with minor fixes or additions sprinkled in between. So not everything on here will be the most up-to-date. Again, you may need to do a bit of your own research.

If you have any suggestions or spot any errors, please raise an issue and I'll try to make an update as soon as I can!
